# Showcasing a legal doc faiss db inspection


Let's go through the code step by step:

- The index is loaded from the specified path using the faiss.read_index() function.
- The dimensionality of the vectors stored in the index is obtained using index.d.
- A random query vector is generated using np.random.rand(). The size of the vector is determined by the dimensionality variable obtained from the loaded index.
- Nearest neighbors search is performed using index.search() by passing the query vector and the number of nearest neighbors to retrieve (k).
- The resulting distances and indices of the nearest neighbors are stored in the distances and indices variables, respectively.
- The nearest neighbors are printed using a loop. For each neighbor, the index and the distance from the query vector are displayed.

Overall, this code allows you to load a Faiss index from a file, generate a query vector, and perform a nearest neighbors search using the loaded index. The nearest neighbors are then printed to the console.
